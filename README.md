## License
We use the MIT License, due to its permissive structure and the piece of mind it provides for contributors. We highly recommend you read the license before maintaining this project, so you have an idea of what is allowed, and what is not allowed.

> You can read the license here: https://github.com/jw0902/qbot/releases/tag/v1.0  

## Note on Discord API
Please note that the Discord has separate terms of conditions for bots running on Discord's API. Please review that here before installing the bot: https://github.com/jw0902/qbot/releases/tag/v1.0

Specifically, this is something very relevant to hosting Qbot:

> You will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personally identifiable information ("PII"). You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your application that uses the API (your “API Client”) that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with Discord and third parties. ([jump to section](https://github.com/jw0902/qbot/releases/tag/v1.0))

It is your responsibility to implement a privacy policy, as mentioned in this quote from the API above. We recommend you join the [Discord Developers](https://github.com/jw0902/qbot/releases/tag/v1.0) server if you have any questions about this policy.
